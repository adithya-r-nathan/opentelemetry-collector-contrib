  The extension now supports unmarshaling AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) flow logs via the new `tgwflow` format.
  Plain-text log files (including gzip-compressed variants) are supported. Parquet format is recognized
  but not yet implemented and will return an explicit error.
  Configure via format: tgwflow with an optional tgwflow.file_format field (defaults to plain-text).
